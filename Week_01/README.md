- Unzip the p5 folder (double click on Mac or right click and select 'Extract All' on Windows)
- Put the unzipped folder in a folder with the path ~/Documents/UWE/Year1/ICC/Week1
- Open the application VS Code
- Create a new window in VS Code by going to file->new window
- Drag the entire p5 folder onto the VS Code window:

- Now just take a look inside the 'empty-example' folder in VS code: we can see our blank sketch in sketch.js. 
- Let's just open the index.html page in our browser too!
