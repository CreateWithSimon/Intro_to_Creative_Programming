# Week 01

## Limbering Up


### Task 1 - Getting Started

- Head to the [p5 website](https://p5js.org/get-started/) and do the "Get Started" section using the online code editor under the heading "Your First Sketch"


### Task 2 - Going Pro



OK it's all well and good being able to edit

- Now go over to [p5 download page](https://p5js.org/download/) and navigate to the download button. Then download the .zip file:

- Unzip the p5 folder (double click on Mac or right click and select 'Extract All' on Windows)
- Put the unzipped folder in a folder with the path ~/Documents/UWE/Year1/ICC/Week1
- Open the application VS Code
- Create a new window in VS Code by going to file->new window
- Drag the entire p5 folder onto the VS Code window:

</p>

- Now just take a look inside the 'empty-example' folder in VS code: we can see our blank sketch in sketch.js. 
- Let's just open the index.html page in our browser too!

- OK, now simply follow the same instructions as on the [Get Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) page to re-create your sketch on your local machine:
