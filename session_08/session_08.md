## HTML, Pure JavaScript and Interaction with the DOM

### Task 1 - HTML Page

Create a new folder on your machine called DOM_DEMO_01 or something that is in line with your previous naming system

Create a new index.html with all the necessary mark up that is required:
	Look in the slides to find the example of the basic page - *DO NOT COPY AND PASTE*

	Make sure you save it as "index.html"


In the body of your index.html create a pair of ```html <script>``` tags

	Inside the tags, add the line:
```javascript 
document.write("Hello Whirled");
```

Open your page, congratulations, youâ€™ve written your first piece of DOM JS code!
