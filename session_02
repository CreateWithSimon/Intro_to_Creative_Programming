## Basic Interactivity


### Task 1 - Drawing with the mouse

Okay let's start with our setup and draw functions.  In ```setup()``` as well as our ```createCanvas()``` function we've got [```fill()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) and [```noStroke()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noStroke).  Check out the links to the reference pages if you're not sure what these do.

```javascript
function setup(){
  createCanvas(500,500);
  fill(0, 102);
  noStroke();
}


function draw() {
  ellipse();
}
```

Can you fill in the values inside the ellipse so that it is drawn at the mouse's location on the screen?
